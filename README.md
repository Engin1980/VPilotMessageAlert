A simple tool playing sound when your callsign, departure or destination airport is mentioned in [VPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/) communication messages.

# Installation

VPilot must be installed prior the plugin installation.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Engin1980/VPilotMessageAlert/releases) page and download the latest ZIP archive.
2. Extract the archive content into the `Plugins` folder in __VPilot__ instalation. Note that all the files must be placed directly into the `Plugins` folder, not in any subfolder

# Setting up
The connection info and flightplan is automatically read from the VPilot connection and online Vatsim data. However, you can adjust the sounds and monitored events and update intervals. All the settings are available in the file `settings.json`.

# Usage
Once added into the `Plugins` folder, there is no additional set up. Just start VPilot and connect into the network.
