# ðŸ›ªðŸ”Š VPilot Alert (plugin) ðŸ”ŠðŸ›ª

A simple tool adding sound **notifications** to [VPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/):
* ðŸ”Š when **your callsign, departure or destination airport is mentioned in radio communication**;
* ðŸ”Š when **contact me ...** message was received but frequency were not tuned;
* ðŸ”Š while **disconnected**;
* ðŸ”Š when **departing without filled VATSIM FlightPlan**.

**Why** Cos I made an airprox with KLM1277 at EGPH, moreover occusing him for not using UNICOM. I overlooked the message in the mess of other chatting. My big apologies.

# ðŸ–´ Installation

This tool is a *plugin* for [VPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/) connecting software. VPilot must be installed **prior** the plugin installation. This tool is tested only on case when VPilot is running at the same computer as the Flight Simulator.

To obtain the tool:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Engin1980/VPilotMessageAlert/releases) page and download the latest ZIP archive.
2. Extract the archive content into the `Plugins` folder in __VPilot__ instalation. Note that all the files must be placed directly into the `Plugins` folder, not in any subfolder

The tool is build based on .NET Framework 4.7.2 (which is used by VPilot by default, so if you are using VPilot, you should be fine) and .NET 6 (which is installed on Windows 10+ devices by default).

# âœ“ Validating instalation
Ensure you are using the default `settings.json` file.

1. Start Flight simulator and the flight.
2. Start VPilot.
3. Connect to the network.
4. Check if a new tab with a private message confirming the plugin state is shown.

Also, you should see:
* VPilot plugin log file at `...\VPilot\Plugins\_VPilotNetCoreBridge.log`
* VPilot Alert log file at `...\VPilot\Plugins\VPilotNetAlert\_VPilotAlert.log` 

If anything goes wrong, check the content of those two files.

# ðŸ›  Setting up (optional)
The connection info and flightplan is automatically read from the VPilot connection and online Vatsim data. However, you can adjust the sounds and monitored events and update intervals. All the settings are available in the configuration file at `...\VPilot\Plugins\VPilotNetAlert\settings.json`.

# ðŸ›ª Usage
Once added into the `Plugins` folder, there is no additional set up. Just start VPilot and connect into the network. However, you can adjust settings - see the previous section.

# âš  Issues

For any issue, feel free to raise a new issue at the [Issues](https://github.com/Engin1980/fs2020-com-to-vpilot-volume/issues) tab. Please add the relevant content of the `log` files if relevant.
